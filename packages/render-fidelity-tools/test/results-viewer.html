    <h2>Render Fidelity Comparison Results</h2>
  
    <p>The purpose of <a href="https://www.khronos.org/gltf/"
    target="_blank" rel="noopener">glTF</a> is to standardize Physically-Based Rendering (PBR)
    materials such that you can be confident your model will appear as intended
    in any lighting environment in any renderer. This is a very ambitious goal,
    as real-time rendering at this level of quality is still very much an area
    of active research with improvements being made constantly. This site
    demonstrates where we are on that path to convergence and highlights areas
    that could still use improvement. We are comparing the most popular web
    renderers: <a href="https://threejs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three.js</a>
    (represented by &lt;model-viewer&gt;), <a
    href="https://google.github.io/filament/webgl/"
    target="_blank" rel="noopener">filament.js</a>, and <a href="https://www.babylonjs.com/"
    target="_blank" rel="noopener">babylon.js</a>. If any other renderers would like to be
    included, please open a PR adding them to the <a
    href="https://github.com/google/model-viewer/tree/master/packages/render-fidelity-tools/src/components/renderers"
    target="_blank" rel="noopener">render-fidelity-tools</a>
    package.</p>

    <p>In addition, we are showing a ground-truth render provided by <a
    href="https://github.com/DassaultSystemes-Technology/dspbr-pt"
    target="_blank" rel="noopener">dspbr-pt</a>, which is a very slow path-tracing renderer
    based on three.js. The advantage it provides is simplicity: without the
    speed requirement it can be made clear and readable and as it runs with more
    and more samples it approaches the physical result with far fewer
    approximations than are necessary in real-time renderers.</p>

    <p>The first set of scenarios are for demonstrating material capabilities,
    so these are primarily fidelity tests. Following these are simpler cases
    that test glTF spec conformance, but are not particularly interesting for
    fidelity. At the bottom are the Furnace Test and the Directional Light Test.
    The Furnace Test checks energy conservation and the correct result is the
    whole 7x7 grid of metal-rough spheres being invisible (indistinguishable
    from the background). The top (metal) and bottom (dielectric) rows are
    passing, while the mixtures lose some energy. The Directional Light Test
    checks the worst-case scenario for environmental lighting approximations:
    the case where a single bright pixel represents a directional light. The
    Filament version uses an actual directional light, so this is the ground
    truth.</p>
      
    <p>In &lt;model-viewer&gt;, we do not consider rendering changes to be breaking
    changes, as our quality is incrementally improving with every release.
    However, the difference between the renders you see here bounds how much you
    can expect our rendering to change going forward. Note the largest
    differences are in the handling of transparent materials, as this is quite
    difficult to get right, so the largest changes will likely be here.</p>
      
    <p>We show a simple logarithmic metric on an average of the pixel
    differences, excluding the transparent background. This is <b>not</b> a
    perceptual metric, so take it with a grain of salt. It is mostly there to
    help us identify regressions.</p>
