# This script updates the screenshots of the third-party renderers that we are
# able to compare to <model-viewer>`. If there are any changes to the
# screenshots, the script then generates a branch and commits the screenshots to
# it. Finally, it opens a PR against the main project on Github.
#
# NOTE: This script is only intended to be run as part of automation
# infrastructure. It will probably work anywhere with the right environment
# variables set but please use it with caution!
