    <p>Interactive 3D models are the next media type, following images and
    video, and as such <code>&lt;model-viewer&gt;</code> and other renderers are
    being used more often to display these 3D models in commercial settings,
    museums, and many more. Both of these users have deep interest in ensuring
    the presented pixels accurately represent the real object the model is based
    on. As such, a quality assurance process is needed to ensure that both the
    3D model itself has been designed accurately, and that the presentation of
    that model is appropriate for realism. While your process may differ based
    on your situation, this document is intended to give the background
    necessary to set up a process and to set expectations.</p>

    <p>Khronos' glTF is the first 3D model format to specify physically-based
    rendering (PBR), meaning it contains material properties that define in
    real-world units how light should be reflected & refracted in terms of
    physics. This means renderers are free to innovate in GPU shaders to create
    more and more accurate approximations of the underlying physics, because
    glTF does not specify any single approximation. This also means that while
    different renderers may make different tradeoffs of accuracy vs. speed you
    can have confidence that your glTF will look consistent (though not
    pixel-identical) even across unrelated codebases. We call glTF the JPEG of
    3D because it is compressed for efficient web delivery and can be rendered
    consistently by a large number viewers.</p>

    <p>At first blush, it may appear that different glTF viewers are not
    consistent, but this is generally not due to rendering differences, but to
    default scene setup. Physically-based rendering means the scene takes
    environment light as input just like a real camera does, so just like to get
    a consistent photo, you need to not just have the same object, but also the
    same lighting and camera settings. There is no standard for the default
    settings of these viewers, so it is important to intentionally set them to
    consistent values. This is precisely what we and Khronos have done to show
    the state of <a
    href="https://github.khronos.org/glTF-Render-Fidelity/comparison/">glTF
    rendering convergence</a> across a variety of popular renderers.</p>

    <h3 id="accuracy">What is color accuracy?</h3>

    <p>The goal of PBR is to create color-accurate images at frame rate as a
    user interacts with the 3D model. Of course a renderer can only be as
    accurate as the input 3D model, so a process to decide if the 3D model is in
    fact accurately representing the real-world object it's based on is also
    crucial, so any errors can be fixed. The most correct way to do this would
    be to set up a photo shoot of the real object, capture the environment
    lighting around it in its full dynamic range, record the camera settings and
    position, then set up an identical rendered scene and compare the output
    images. Unfortunately this tends to be prohibitively expensive.</p>

    <p>Even in this idealized comparison scenario, there is a non-trivial issue:
    what metric does one use to compare the images? Simple pixel comparison
    metrics like PSNR tend to give too much weight to differences that are not
    noticeable. Thus perceptual metrics are better, but also more arbitrary and
    harder to define.</p>

    <p>Since many products are designed with RGB material specs (like paint), a
    common idea is to simply reflect this in the baseColor of the glTF. This can
    be a good approach to color-accurate modeling, provided the RGB value is in
    the proper color space. The glTF spec says the baseColor factor (normalized
    between zero and one) is exactly the fraction of the given channel
    (wavelength) of light reflected by the material. The baseColor texture is
    the same, but put through the sRGB transfer function to extract linear
    values first. It should not be assumed that a given paint swatch RGB value
    is defined the same way.</p>

    <p>When it comes to verifying that the render is color-accurate, the first
    idea is often to check that the output rendered image has the same RGB pixel
    values as the glTF baseColor (or the expected paint swatch RGB). <b>This is
    a fundamentally incorrect expectation, as it negates the purpose of
    physically-based rendering!</b> Details and examples follow to support this
    assertion and to point the way towards a more useful verification scheme.</p>

    <h3 id="matching">What's wrong with the rendered color matching the baseColor?</h3>

    <p>The most important thing to understand about PBR is that it accurately
    represents the interplay between incident light and material properties,
    of which there are several beyond just baseColor, the most important of
    which are metalness and roughness. However, the rendered output for a given
    pixel is only RGB, which means if it matched the baseColor RGB, then by
    definition the incident light and other material properties could not in
    any way affect the resulting image.</p>

    <p>Let's start with a simple example: six spheres with uniform materials.
    The top row are white (baseColor RGB: [1, 1, 1]), while the bottom row are
    yellow (baseColor RGB: [1, 1, 0]). From left to right they are shiny metal
    (metalness: 1, roughness: 0), shiny plastic (metalness: 0, roughness: 0),
    and matte plastic (metalness: 0, roughness: 1). The left-most can be
    thought of approximately as polished silver and gold.</p>

      <model-viewer

      </model-viewer>
      <figcaption>A basic example of spheres with different uniform materials.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Note how different materials with the same baseColor render differently.
    Which pixels match the baseColor RGB? In fact, if you really want the
    rendered pixels to match the baseColor RGB values, glTF has an extension
    specifically for this: KHR_materials_unlit. This extension is not
    physically-based, and so is appropriate for things like labels and 3D scans
    that produce only RGB textures with all applied lighting baked in as part of
    the capture process. This is how the above model looks with the unlit
    extension:</p>

     <figure>
      <model-viewer
        src="../../shared-assets/models/silver-gold-unlit.gltf"
        skybox-image="../../shared-assets/environments/neutral.hdr"
        camera-controls
        alt="3D model of six example material spheres"
      >
      </model-viewer>
      <figcaption>The same spheres as above using the glTF unlit extension.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Now that it's clear that lighting is important in making a 3D model look
    realistic, the next common idea is to choose a nice uniformly neutral
    lighting scenario to make the output RGB values "close to" the intended
    baseColor. Well, it's easy to produce a uniform lighting environment, but
    the results may be surprising for PBR:</p>

     <figure>
      <model-viewer
        src="../../shared-assets/models/silver-gold.gltf"
        skybox-image="../../shared-assets/environments/white_furnace.hdr"

        alt="3D model of six example material spheres"
      >
      </model-viewer>
      <figcaption>Physically-based rendering with uniform lighting.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>It may look like the white spheres have vanished, but they're still
    present - tilt the view and you can see them occluding the yellow spheres.
    In fact they are just perfectly camouflaged. This scene is known as a
    furnace test, which is used to check energy conservation of the renderer,
    which ours passes. It can be shown with physics that under perfectly uniform
    lighting, these white spheres should each uniformly reflect exactly the same
    light as is incident from the environment, and hence be indistinguishable
    from the background.</p>

    <p>Note this result with the yellow spheres is actually pretty close to the
    unlit result - there's almost no discernable difference between shiny and
    matte or metal and plastic. This is in fact accurate; if you really found a
    place with perfectly uniform lighting, you wouldn't be able to tell the
    difference between those materials either (assuming you could somehow also
    hide your own reflection - you are also a part of your lighting
    environment). The reason this looks so unreal is that it is nearly
    impossible to find an environment like this. Real environments have texture,
    and the reflections of that texture are what we use to understand
    shininess.</p>

    <p>Next let's return to the original version, which uses
    <code>&lt;model-viewer&gt;</code>'s default "neutral" environment-image. Details of
    how this environment was designed can be found <a
    href="https://github.com/google/model-viewer/pull/1761">here</a> and <a
    href="https://github.com/google/model-viewer/pull/2249">here</a>. The
    lighting is intended to be even (from all sides), though not uniform, thus
    providing enough texture to discern material types. It is purely grayscale,
    thus not shifting the hues of the materials. This is as opposed to indoor
    lighting which might skew yellow, outdoor that might skew blue, or sunsets
    that might skew red. PBR will faithfully produce the colors a camera would
    capture in these scenarios, which of course will look different than the
    same object under neutral lighting.</p>

      </model-viewer>
      <figcaption>Back to the original example, but with an exposure slider.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Note that the top-right ball we might call paper-white: a perfect matte
    reflector. However, despite the white baseColor (sRGB: [255, 255, 255]),
    notice that the rendered color varies from [177, 177, 177] to [237, 237,
    237], never achieving pure white. Why is this? Notice that the top-middle
    ball does have some reflections off its shiny surface that are pure white.
    These specular reflections are in addition to its diffuse reflection (which
    is all you get from a matte surface), so if the diffuse reflection had
    already saturated our pixels, it would be impossible to discern a shiny
    object from a matte one. Try increasing the exposure slider to see the
    effect, which in photography is referred to as overexposure.</p>

    <p>You might notice that exposure appears to affect the midrange values more
    than the blacks and whites (despite exposure being a linear light
    multiplier). You would be correct, and this is caused by the nonlinear tone
    mapping step that happens last in the rendering pipeline. Tone mapping is a
    complicated topic in its own right, but it is vital to understanding PBR.
    Before we get into that, let's begin by comparing the rendering and
    photography pipelines.</p>

    <h3 id="photography">How does rendering compare to photography?</h3>

    <p>3D rendering, especially PBR, is designed to mimic photography, and
    photography in turn is designed to mimic the human eye and brain. The brain
    part is essential, as the goal of a realistic photo is to evoke the same
    perception by looking at it as one would have looking at the original scene.
    This is difficult as the light reflected by a printed photo or emitted by a
    display is dramatically less intense and has less contrast than the real
    world. Even HDR displays have orders of magnitude less contrast than your
    eye sees on a normal outdoor day.</p>

    <p>Thankfully, our brains do a lot of adjustment to our perception,
    including correcting for contrast. This allows us to print photos with a
    very compressed dynamic range while still giving the perception of e.g. a
    real sunset. This compression of dynamic range we'll refer to as tone
    mapping. In photography you can think of this as the conversion from the
    camera's raw image (which tends to look washed out) to the final image. It
    becomes even more important in modern photography with exposure stacking,
    where a higher dynamic range raw image can be produced than the sensor is
    capable of in a single shot.</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="../assets/Pipelines.png"/>
      <figcaption>Comparison of photography and 3D rendering pipelines.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>In 3D rendering, there is no sensor and computations are done in floating
    point, which means the raw image is effectively full HDR, with even more
    range than is generally possible with exposure stacking. Looking at a
    histogram of this raw image will often show a very long tail, representing
    the small, shiny glints that are orders of magnitude more intense than the
    rest of the scene. In order to maintain perception while compressing down to
    SDR, a nonlinear tone mapping curve is used.</p>

    <p>Tone mapping comes at the difficult intersection between art and science.
    We have found through painful experience that the existing tone mapping
    functions do not meet the needs of e-commerce for color-accuracy, and so we
    have developed the Khronos PBR Neutral tone mapper for exactly this purpose. If you have
    precise sRGB color swatches that you have used to create your glTF materials
    and want them to come through as unaltered as possible, we strongly
    recommend using our "neutral" tone-mapping function and our default
    lighting or another suitable grayscale lighting environment.</p>

    <p>Below is an example where you can see first-hand how much difference tone
    mapping makes. ACES has been a defacto standard in the PBR industry for some
    time, but it should be easy to see its serious flaws, including both hue
    skews (blue to purple, red to orange) and saturation loss. AgX is a newer
    and better tone mapper that holds hue better, but still has significant
    contrast and saturation loss, which is desirable for its intended use cases
    in games and film. For detail, please see our technical document on the
    tradeoffs in <a href="tone-mapping.html">tone mapping</a> and how our
    Commerce tone mapper was designed.</p>

    <h3 id="validate-render">How do we validate a glTF 3D render?</h3>

    <p>Hopefully the preceding discussion has convinced you that simply
    validating some rendered pixel color against the object's "correct" color is
    not a useful or valid process. If only it were so simple! Instead you need
    to look at your whole pipeline and consider what your end goals really
    are.</p>

    <p>For the sake of measurability, let's consider the end goal to be
    minimizing the return rate of products bought online where the shopper's
    primary visual cue is a 3D model (let's assume we're making a decent enough
    render that we're not destroying the purchasing rate). To succeed, we must
    render images that the shopper perceives to be equivalent to their
    perception of the actual product when it arrives. This is exactly the same
    goal as a photograph of this product in a magazine or on a website.</p>

    <p>There is a much longer history of product photography, so let's start
    there. What does a product photographer's pipeline look like? Obviously they
    vary, but the overall steps will tend to look like: 1) lighting setup, 2)
    camera setup, 3) take the photos, 4) post-processing. Ideally, it is
    possible to capture this lighting environment, convert the camera setup to
    matrices and exposure, use the same post-processing, author the glTF
    according to measured material properties, and output a render that will
    match the photo quite well (especially with a path-traced renderer). </p>

    <p>It is tempting to blame any observed discrepancies on the renderer,
    especially real-time rasterizers, but in fact a lot of research has gone
    into making them amazingly physically accurate and consistent, as you can
    see in our <a href="../fidelity">fidelity comparisons</a>. <b>Nearly always the
    most serious errors are differences in lighting, materials, exposure, and
    post-processing.</b></p>

    <p>Let's consider for a moment what happens in the photography
    post-processing step. Some things don't apply to rendering, like masking out
    shadows to make them semi-transparent - a 3D renderer can do this
    automatically. In addition to color-neutral tone mapping, sometimes the
    colors are intentionally "corrected". Why? After all, if the captured light
    from the actual scene is not correct, what is?</p>

    <p>It may be that some of the post-processing color correction is simply a
    matter of expediency. Before digital photography, to get the right look, the
    lighting and scene had to be adjusted, which involves manual labor. Digital
    post-processing can allow the lighting to be less precise. However in 3D
    rendering, the lighting is equally digital, so it is generally a better
    practice to keep the post-processing step simple (e.g. just tone
    mapping) and adjust the environment image if necessary. Since 3D rendering is
    happening completely automatically in real time, there is no way to make
    manual bespoke color adjustments for each frame.</p>
  
    <h3 id="perception">What role does perception play?</h3>

    <p>As with photography, the goal is the viewer's perception of the image.
    There is no mathematical metric that will represent human perception as well
    as the perception of an actual human. Isolated pixel metrics are problematic
    because much of human perception is affected by the background and
    surroundings of the object. This is because our brains are effectively
    trying to remove the effect of lighting and allow us to perceive the
    underlying material properties consistently. Our brains estimate what
    lighting to remove based on the background.</p>

    <p>When rendering a product in AR using the camera image as the background,
    to get the most consistent <i>perception</i> of the product, its actual
    rendered pixels need to change color, ideally according the actual local
    lighting environment. This helps ensure that when our brain "corrects" for
    the lighting, our perception returns to the real object's properties. Of
    course this is only as good as the AR lighting estimation algorithms, but
    they are improving. Ideally, the same tone mapping and white balance that's
    applied to the camera's raw image should be used in the rendering pipeline
    as well. Unfortunately, it may be difficult to access this data.</p>

    <p>Of course human perception is not uniform, which makes all of this even
    more difficult. An excellent example is the famous <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_dress">dress photo</a> which is
    actually a blue and black dress in an overexposed photo under yellow
    lighting. Even though the pixel colors are roughly purple and brown, more
    than half of people correctly perceived the dress as blue and black, though
    another 30% perceived it as white and gold. Obviously this kind of ambiguous
    image is not desireable in a commerce setting, but it is useful for
    understanding how much perceived color can differ from pixel color. The
    Scientific Explanations sections of that article is full of interesting

    <h3 id="validate-gltf">How do we validate a glTF model?</h3>

    <p>Generally speaking, part of the purpose of 3D rendering is to avoid the
    cost of photography, by making the entire process digital. The 3D model is
    costly for an artist to create, but it persists for creating many different
    photo shoots and interactive experiences quickly. So how can this 3D model be
    verified as accurate to the physical product? Of course dimensions and shape
    can be measured (glTF is always in meters, so check your units), but we'll
    be focusing on material properties here, like baseColor and roughness.</p>

    <p>The most accurate way to choose material properties is to measure them,
    since all glTF materials are defined in physical terms. However, these
    measurements are difficult to make. There are products on the market that
    will scan an inserted material swatch and fit these properties to it, and
    hopefully these machines will become more common. Modern 3D scanning
    algorithms can back out material properties, but these machine learning
    systems are not perfect and are difficult to benchmark. Until these
    technologies are further along, we may not have access to properly
    measured material properties.</p>

    <p>The most common workflow for creating materials is that a 3D artist
    manually adjusts the properties until the render looks right. Ideally the
    artist has the physical object on their desk and compares to their render,
    thus focusing on perception rather than pixel values. However, <b>it is of
    utmost importance that their authoring software is set up to render the same
    way as the object will be presented to users.</b> This is because when the
    render doesn't look right, it could be that either the materials or the
    lighting needs to change. If the materials are measured one can safely focus
    on changing the lighting, but if not, it is very helpful to have chosen a
    fixed lighting environment ahead of time to remove that variable. Equally
    important is that the tone mapping function used is consistent. If you're
    not sure what is being used, it's probably inconsistent.</p>

    <p>Ideally the artist should check the rendering of the model under a
    variety of lighting environments. Certain types of lighting will tend to
    hide or expose certain material property errors. At minimum, it's a good
    idea to test with both a neutral indoor environment and with a sunny outdoor
    environment. The sun will produce very high dynamic range, as well as
    colored lighting, which will help with detecting a variety of possible
    material problems. These scenarios will tend to bracket a wide variety of
    real lighting situations that might be applied for a virtual photo shoot or
    in AR, which should give confidence the asset can be reused broadly.</p>

    <p>Finally, all the usual caveats apply regarding <a
    href="https://z-fx.nl/ColorspACES.pdf">colorspaces</a> and differences
    between displays. The glTF format specifies the use of the sRGB colorspace
    internally, which is also the most common output format, but with HDR
    displays becoming more common this is likely to become more complicated
    soon.</p>

    <h3 id="takeaway">What's the takeaway?</h3>

    <p>Unfortunately there are no easy answers, as color and perception are
    complex, even more so than physically-based rendering. Hopefully this
    background gives a framework on which your authoring and validation
    processes can be built. The most important thing to remember about PBR is
    that the whole point is for the rendered colors to vary compared to the
    material baseColor, which is what allows the demo below to be compellingly
    realistic.</p>

    <p>Still, for most e-commerce vendors that are likely managing separate
    contracts for 3D model creation and interactive website design, simplicity
    is key to cost-effectiveness. My recommendation is to use our PBR Neutral tone
    mapping and if you already have approved marketing colors for your products,
    then tell your artists to use those for the baseColor. Use a grayscale
    lighting environment (like our default), adjusting if necessary to place
    highlights and change exposure.</p>
    
    <p>If the color is not known, but being matched by eye, then ensure the
    artist's tools also use the Khronos PBR Neutral tone mapper and a lighting environment
    that is as close as possible to the production grayscale lighting
    environment. Since our PBR Neutral tone mapper is relatively new, it may not be
    available in tools; in this case the next best thing is to turn off tone
    mapping entirely. Make sure to educate your artists on the differences they
    can expect - blown out highlights with hue skews, and saturation loss for
    dark colors. Ensure they also frequently test their output in a
    near-production environment, hopefully using &lt;model-viewer&gt; with
    <code>tone-mapping="neutral"</code>. This way they can calibrate and ensure
    the end user will see realistic colors.</p>
