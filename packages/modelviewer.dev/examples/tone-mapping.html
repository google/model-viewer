    <h3 id="purpose">The purpose of tone mapping</h3>

    <p>Tone mapping is a general term, which can refer to basically any color
    conversion function. Even separate operations that a photographer might
    apply in post processing, such as gamma correction, saturation, contrast,
    and even things like sepia can all be combined into a single resulting
    function that here we're calling tone mapping. Setting aside artistic color
    grading, we are looking at generic, neutral tone mappers designed to pull
    out-of-range colors back into the limits of our display device in a
    perceptually-pleasing way.</p>

    <p>The default tone mapping function used by
    <code>&lt;model-viewer&gt;</code> has been ACES, which is a standard
    developed by the film industry and is widely used for 3D rendering, though
    it has some problems. Like most tone mapping curves, it is fairly linear in
    the central focus of its contrast range, then asymptotes out to smoothly
    compress the long tails of brights and darks into the required zero to one
    output range, the idea being that humans perceive less difference between
    over-bright and over-dark zones as compared to the bulk of the scene.
    However, since some output range is reserved for these extra-bright
    highlights, the range left over to represent the input range of matte
    baseColors is also reduced. This is why a paper-white material does
    not produce white pixels.</p>

    <p>Sometimes when working with matte objects and trying to compare output
    color to baseColor, this tone mapping compression will be noticed and
    identified as the source of the apparent tone discrepancy. The immediate
    thought is usually, let's fix this by not applying tone mapping! The problem
    is there is actually no such thing as "no tone mapping", since somehow the
    unbounded input range must be converted to the zero-to-one range that the
    encoder expects. If this step is not done, the encoder simply clamps the
    values, which amounts to a piecewise-linear tone mapping function with sharp
    corners that introduce perceptual errors for shiny objects, as shown in the
    example below.</p>

     <figure>
      <model-viewer
        id="toneMapping"
        src="../../shared-assets/models/silver-gold.gltf"
        skybox-image="../../shared-assets/environments/neutral.hdr"

        alt="3D model of six example material spheres"
      >
      <p><label for="toneMapped">Tone Mapped: </label>
      <input id="toneMapped" type="checkbox" checked></p>
      </model-viewer>
      <figcaption>Toggle ACES tone mapping to see the difference it makes.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>This model has six spheres with uniform materials: The top row are white
    (baseColor RGB: [1, 1, 1]), while the bottom row are yellow (baseColor RGB:
    [1, 1, 0]). From left to right they are shiny metal (metalness: 1,
    roughness: 0), shiny plastic (metalness: 0, roughness: 0), and matte plastic
    (metalness: 0, roughness: 1). The left-most can be thought of approximately
    as polished silver and gold.</p>

    <p>Tick the checkbox to remove tone mapping for a quick comparison. Note
    that the shiny and matte white plastic spheres are now indistinguishable.
    Since half of the matte white sphere is now rendering pure white, there is
    no headroom for shiny highlights. Likewise, the top half of the sphere loses
    its 3D appearance since the shading was removed by clamping the values.
    </p>

    <p>This example also highlights a second key element of good tone mapping
    functions: desaturating overexposed colors. Look at the golden sphere
    (lower-left) and compare to when ACES tone mapping is applied. The baseColor
    of a metal multiplies the incoming light, so a white light on a golden
    sphere produces a yellow reflection (fully saturated yellow, in this case of
    a fully saturated baseColor). With clamped tone mapping, the highlight is
    indeed saturated yellow, but this does not look perceptually right, even
    though you could make the argument it is physically correct.</p>

    <p>Tone mapping curves like ACES not only compress the luma, but also
    push colors toward white the brighter they are. This is why the highlights
    on the golden sphere become white instead of yellow. This follows both the
    behavior of camera sensors and our eyes when responding to overexposed
    colored light. You can see this effect simply by looking at a candle's flame
    or a spark, the brightest parts of which tend to look white despite their
    color. Nvidia has helpfully provided more <a
    href="https://developer.nvidia.com/preparing-real-hdr">details</a> on tone
    mapping and HDR for the interested reader.</p>

    <p>One final way to avoid tone mapping that is sometimes suggested is to
    choose an exposure such that all pixels are inside the [0, 1] range, such
    that value clamping is avoided. For matte objects with low-dynamic-range
    lighting, this can give semi-decent results, but it breaks down completely
    for shiny objects, as shown in the following screenshot.</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="../assets/ExposureFit.png"/>
      <figcaption>Image of the above spheres with no tone mapping and exposure
      set to avoid clamping.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>The trouble is that the specular highlights are orders of magnitude
    brighter than the majority of the scene, so to fit them into the output
    range requires the exposure to be lowered by more than a factor of 50. This
    kills the brightness and contrast of the majority of the scene, because of
    just a few small highlights. And this neutral environment does not have very
    high dynamic range; if you were to use an outdoor environment that includes
    the sun, the exposure would have to be so low that nearly the entire render
    would be black.</p>

    <p>Everything shown here is rendered to an 8-bit sRGB output, but HDR
    displays and formats are getting more common. Might we be able to avoid tone
    mapping by keeping the HDR of our raw image in an HDR output format? The
    short answer is no, because HDR displays may be high dynamic range compared
    to traditional SDR, but they are still orders of magnitude short of what our
    eyes experience in the real world, so all the same reasons for tone mapping
    still apply. However, it is important to note that the choice of tone
    mapping function should be dependent on the output format. Ideally it would
    even depend on the display's contrast ratio, its brightness settings, and
    the level of ambient lighting around it, but this data is unlikely to be
    available.</p>

    <h3 id="tradeoffs">Tradeoffs</h3>

    <p>The difficulty with compressing a nearly infinite HDR range down to sRGB
    is the necessary loss of information. For the highlights to be discernable,
    the neutral contrast must be reduced, so a paper-white object must appear
    dimmer than 255 under diffuse lighting. For the highlights to desaturate
    appropriately and smoothly, the highest saturation colors of sRGB become
    unreachable under any lighting.</p>

    <p>The primary problem with ACES (and even AgX) tone mapping reported by
    e-commerce users is their significant loss of saturation. Many artists have
    been frustrated by their inability to produce a desired product color
    (generally dictated by marketing) with any combination of material
    properties and lighting, but few have realized that the tone mapping
    function is in fact the limiting factor. For example, the following figure
    shows the reachable set of ACES tone mapping, assuming sRGB inputs and
    outputs for both material properties and lighting, as specified by glTF.</p>

    <figure>

      <figcaption>Comparison of the ACES and PBR Neutral tone mapping reachable colors. The cube represents the [0, 1] space in linear light - no sRGB curve has been applied.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Note that canary yellow, bright greens and blues are all impossible to
    output to the screen. This is partly because ACES comes from the film
    industry, where inputs may often be wider-gamut than sRGB, thus making more
    of these colors reachable. It is also because in film, the image detail is
    important across a wide spectrum of the HDR input range, so it makes sense
    to sacrifice more saturation for the sake of smoothly compressing a larger
    range. Finally, in film, the viewer is generally immersed, so the brain has
    no bright surrounding colors to compare to. This allows our perceptual
    system to compensate for the loss of saturation, allowing the image to still
    look good, instead of washed-out.</p>

    <h3 id="needs">The needs of e-commerce</h3>

    <p>Unfortunately, the needs of e-commerce are quite different than the needs
    of film or gaming. On a website, a 3D product model will be side-by-side with
    sRGB product photos, and a user may often compare the image on their screen
    to a printed image in a catalogue or to the physical product they have
    received. Of course it is exceedingly difficult to succeed in these
    comparisons, as there is no way to match the user's lighting environment to
    the photo studio's, nor to make a catalogue or screen emit light with the
    same intensity as a real-world reflection.</p>

    <p>What we can do is leverage the existing tools, processes, and experience
    of the artists, photographers, and marketers to match their existing product
    photography pipelines where they have been working to solve these problems
    already for years. The best way to make this easy for them is to ensure the
    baseColor assigned in the glTF shows through faithfully in the final render
    under neutral (grayscale) lighting. Faithful does not mean unchanged -
    certainly the brightness must vary to represent realistic shadowing and
    reflection, while metallic highlights must desaturate. However, hue should
    remain unchanged (except of course in the presence of colored, e.g. outdoor,
    lighting) and saturation should be retained as much as possible.</p>

    <p>The reason for adhering to the baseColor is simplicity and expediency:
    when product colors are updated, it will be much easier to modify and verify
    the sRGB values in the textures where they are relatively uniform, than in
    the final render where they vary greatly with lighting. And when a product
    render doesn't look "right", one can have confidence in the model and only
    vary the lighting to achieve the proper look, just as a photographer would.
    This allows for a convenient separation of concerns between product (model)
    and marketing (lighting).</p>

    <p>Commerce is much less interested in the detail of bright HDR regions.
    Studio lighting is intentionally crafted to avoid overexposure and focus on
    the important details of the product. While the brightness of highlights are
    orders of magnitude higher than sRGB, they are generally just the outlines
    of lights, whose blurred edges key our perception of the material's
    shininess. Details within this bright light are not important, so aggressive
    compression of the range of these highlights is much more reasonable than in
    film.</p>

    <p>We are focused on sRGB for both input (glTF) and output (web browsers),
    to meet the industry where it is today, which simplifies the tone mapping
    problem considerably compared to the film industry. This is because one of
    the most difficult aspects of tone mapping is gamut mapping, where colors
    from a larger input gamut like P3 must be squeezed into a smaller gamut like
    sRGB. Conveniently, the glTF standard (like most 3D model workflows)
    specifies that all color textures and lights are in the sRGB gamut. This
    means that regardless of the colorspace used internally, all rendered colors
    will automatically be inside the sRGB gamut (Rec.709), though potentially at
    much higher brightness. Even if the display device is not sRGB, since sRGB
    uses the smallest color gamut, no gamut mapping will ever be required, until
    3D models contain larger-gamut textures. </p>

    <p>HDR monitors are working their way into the mainstream and we will need
    to adjust our curves appropriately to support their higher contrast. The
    approach to tone mapping outlined in the following section should be
    generalizable to these situations, but there will be additional challenges
    beyond tone mapping as well.</p>

    <h3 id="commerce">Khronos PBR Neutral tone mapper</h3>

    <p>The Khronos PBR Neutral tone mapper is designed to be simple to
    implement, fast to run, and faithfully reproduce color as much as possible
    while eliminating HDR artifacts around highlights. It is intended to be 1:1
    for colors up to a certain maximum value, with the remainder used as
    headroom for the compressed highlights. I developed it under the auspices of
    the Khronos 3D Commerce working group to create an industry standard for
    e-commerce and an improved alternative for any PBR render that currently
    disables tone mapping.</p>

    <p>I found that an actual 1:1 tone mapping function led to slightly
    desaturated colors, most noticeably for dark colors. I tracked this problem
    down to PBR itself: for a common dielectric material with index of
    refraction of 1.5, the normal Fresnel reflection adds 4% of the incident
    light color (the highlight) to the material's colored diffuse reflection.
    Assuming the lighting is even and white, this leads to a 4% desaturation of
    the rendered color as compared to the baseColor. This is physically correct,
    but confusing from a color-management perspective.</p>

    <p>I correct our saturation by shifting the 1:1 portion of our tone mapping
    curve down by 0.04. Even though this only exactly corrects the average case,
    it does a very good job overall. This has the useful secondary effect of
    giving us a place to add a contrast "toe", which is a common element of most
    tone mapping functions that helps the blacks look better. I built this toe
    by fitting a simple quadratic function to match our piecewise slope.</p>

    <p>Since tone mapping is about fitting into the sRGB cube, I intentionally
    avoid any use of luminance weights, as the edges of the sRGB cube are not at
    all constant luminance. Instead I scale down colors by a scalar multiplier,
    thus preserving hue and saturation while reducing brightness (there are many
    definitions for these terms, so please bear with my imprecision). The
    brightness metric I use is the maximum value of R, G, and B, and the goal is
    to smoothly reduce this metric to the 0-1 range.</p>

    <p>I chose to fit a simple 1/x function and match the piecewise slope of our
    1:1 portion, as this gives an asymptote with a reasonable tail. It has only
    a single parameter: the value where we switch from the linear to the
    nonlinear function. The purpose of the Khronos PBR Neutral tone mapper is to be a
    standard and thus without parameters, so I chose 0.8 after much testing.
    However, this is likely the most natural place to adjust the curve to HDR
    output from sRGB.</p>

    <p>Converting 0.8 to sRGB gives 231, so any baseColor with R, G, and B
    values below 231 will be faithfully reproduced under even, white lighting.
    The compression reduces 255 to 243, so all highlights that would be clipped
    end up mapped to the 243-255 range.</p>

    <p>The final piece is to create the path to white for desaturating bright
    highlights. This is particularly important for matte materials and shiny
    metals, as they physically color the light they reflect, but perceptually
    that color is lost when it is sufficiently bright. I accomplish this by
    taking a convex combination of the compressed color and white, only in the
    nonlinear compression region. In fact, "white" is slightly darkened in order
    to maintain constant brightness with the compressed color, which makes this
    tone mapper easily invertible.</p>

    <p>The convex parameter function I chose is another 1/x, this time based on
    the amount of brightness removed in the compression step, which ensures it
    starts smoothly with a zero derivative where it begins to take effect. The
    only other parameter in this tone mapper controls the rate of desaturation,
    which I chose as 0.15, which is significantly slower to approach its
    asymptote than the compression function. This is what helps produce our
    smoother gradients and hide the aggressiveness of our compression. In a
    sense I am replacing the lost brightness with desaturation, thus giving the
    brain an alternate perceptual cue, which smoothly encodes several orders of
    magnitude more brightness than is available in the output screen.</p>

    <p>Careful use of the minimum and maximum of the three color channel values
    ensures that this tone mapping function has continuous gradients everywhere
    and in all dimensions, which is key to avoiding eye-catching artifacts in
    the output renders. The complete shader code is quite small, with only three
    divides and those only applied to colors over the 1:1 limit:<br/>
    <code>
  float startCompression = 0.8 - 0.04;
  float desaturation = 0.15;

  vec3 CommerceToneMapping( vec3 color ) {
    float x = min(color.r, min(color.g, color.b));
    float offset = x &lt; 0.08 ? x - 6.25 * x * x : 0.04;
    color -= offset;

    float peak = max(color.r, max(color.g, color.b));
    if (peak &lt; startCompression) return color;

    float d = 1. - startCompression;
    float newPeak = 1. - d * d / (peak + d - startCompression);
    color *= newPeak / peak;

    float g = 1. - 1. / (desaturation * (peak - newPeak) + 1.);
    return mix(color, newPeak * vec3(1, 1, 1), g);
  }
    </code>
    </p>

    <h3 id="validation">Validation</h3>

    <p>The best end-to-end validation we have for color accuracy is to apply an
    unrealistic, analytic lighting environment: a white furnace test, where the
    lighting is exactly uniform [1, 1, 1] white everywhere. This allows us to
    expect a nearly-exact reproduction of baseColor to the output render, and
    thus ensure our tone mapping function is not introducing further
    changes.</p>

    <p>Our 3D Macbeth chart model is ideal for this validation because tone
    mapping is not applied at all to unlit materials, so the unlit spheres serve
    as ground truth color comparisons for the PBR spheres. As you can see, they match
    very well, in fact as close as is possible to match for PBR: there are
    two expected sources of difference.</p>

    <p>The first difference is due to multi-scattering, which causes the
    dark-colored matte (front) spheres to be slightly darker than their unlit
    comparisons. This is intentional, as matte materials are rough, thus
    forming microscopic cavities that cause slight ambient occlusion and allow
    dark materials more light bounces to absorb energy. Accurate PBR renderers
    include this effect because a single material will in fact become brighter
    as it is polished.</p>

    <p>The second difference is from the Fresnel effect: on shiny materials, the
    reflection loses material color near grazing angles. This is a physical
    reality and causes the white halos on the edges of the shiny (back) spheres.
    If you turn the model until the unlit spheres overlap the middle of the
    shiny spheres, you'll see that the color match is exact at normal (center)
    reflection.</p>

    <h3 id="ocio">OpenColorIO profile</h3>

    <p><a href="https://opencolorio.org/">OpenColorIO</a> Is a standard for
    representing color space conversions and color grading, supported by many 3D
    authoring tools. To represent the most general possible functions, instead
    of specifying equations they use 3D lookup tables (LUTs). To help authors
    try out Khronos PBR Neutral tone mapping within their existing workflows, I have
    generated an equivalent OCIO config and a LUT in the common .cube format.
    You can download <a href="pbrNeutral.cube">pbrNeutral.cube</a> and <a
    href="config.ocio">config.ocio</a>, which is modified from the
    <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> config to add PBR Neutral as a
    view transform for color management with an sRGB display device.</p>

    <p>In order to try PBR Neutral tone mapping in Blender, you need to replace the
    config.ocio file with the above version. The original file can be found in
    the Blender install directory, e.g.
    <code>Blender/Contents/Resources/4.0/datafiles/colormanagement</code> on a
    Mac install. You will also need to add <code>pbrNeutral.cube</code> to the
    <code>luts</code> directory on the same path. Then start Blender and at the
    bottom of the Render tab, under Color Management, select sRGB for Display
    Device and PBR Neutral for View Transform.</p>

    <p>I have tested this on a Macbook Pro, which uses a P3 display, but found
    that I achieved consistent colors when setting the display device to sRGB.
    This was to achieve consistency with Chrome and Safari rendering on the same
    device, so this may change in the future as color management on the web
    improves. Note that unlike &lt;model-viewer&gt;, Blender also applies its
    view transform to unlit materials. This makes the 3D Macbeth model above a
    little harder to use, as the unlit spheres can no longer be used as a
    reference.</p>

    <p>The critical addition to the Blender OCIO config is the following, but
    this will likely need some modification to fit into an existing OCIO config
    in a different tool that has colorspaces defined under different names.</p>

    <p><code>

    <h3 id="adoption">Adoption</h3>

    <p>Of course a standardized color-accurate tone mapper is most useful when
    it is universally available, so that everyone from artists to marketers to
    end users can see the product the same way and ensure quality. This is
    precisely why Khronos is pushing this as an industry standard for renderers
    and authoring tools alike to adopt, as an option for tools that support
    multiple tone mappers, and as the default for those that don't. This section
    will be occasionally updated to reflect our progress in adoption across
    industry tools.</p>

    <p>So far two major open-source renderers have added PBR Neutral tone
    mapping, and both should be available in public releases in March 2024: <a
    href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/pull/27668">Three.js</a> and <a
    href="https://github.com/google/filament/pull/7597">Filament</a>.
    <a href="lightingandenv/#toneMapping">&lt;model-viewer&gt;</a> already
    supports it, currently under the name "commerce", and it will become default
    in v4. It is already the default in the &lt;model-viewer&gt; <a
    href="../editor">editor</a>. A proposal has been made to add it to <a
    href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/118824">Blender</a>,
    and discussions are ongoing with other major 3D authoring tools.</p>

    <h3 id="white">White point</h3>

    <p>The tl;dr of this section is that you can safely skip it. It is a
    discussion of the difference between physically correct and practical
    approaches to color management.</p>

    <p>In developing this tone mapping function while addressing the needs of
    our own GStore, I found some peculiar data. I had always said the best way
    to choose the baseColor of your product material (we'll assume it is a
    simple, uniform color for now) was to scan it with a calibrated spectrometer
    under a controlled lighting environment. It turns out GStore does exactly
    this with all their Pixel products. However, they also have a marketing team
    that decides on correct sRGB colors to display for each product, using a
    person with a calibrated monitor in a light-controlled room and the product
    in-hand.</p>

    <p>These colors did not match. And not just brightness - even the hue varied
    significantly, at least to an artist's eyes. Which should we use? Like in
    most e-commerce shops, marketing makes the rules, and their color must be
    followed. But it bothered me; these differences were not random, like
    possible variations in human perception. What was causing the
    discrepancy?</p>

    <p>Finally I realized the root of at least most of the problem, when it
    occurred to me that all the marketing colors were generally red-shifted from
    the scanned ones. The white point of sRGB is D65 (the white point of your
    monitor), or 6500K if you've ever shopped for a lightbulb. The lighting
    marketing used with their calibrated monitor room was D50, to match the
    5000K bulbs they have in their retail stores, which is significantly yellower.</p>

    <p>To achieve PBR realism, we would need not grayscale lighting, which is
    D65 per the sRGB spec, but yellow D50 lighting. At first I championed this
    approach as the most physically-correct. However, all of our technical
    artists balked at this idea - it was hard to explain, meant keeping track of
    multiple colors, and introduced many places errors could subtly enter the
    pipeline.</p>

    <p>We decided instead to take the practical approach of using the
    marketing-approved color as baseColor, with simple grayscale lighting to
    avoid skewing it. This isn't exactly correct according to PBR and the sRGB
    white point, but I think you'll find it very hard to detect the error.
    Considering other much bigger approximations we have baked in like operating
    on three colors instead of using a spectral renderer, smaller things are
    worth ignoring.</p>

    <p>However, when measuring color, remember that colorspace and white point
    are very important, and while a tool may be precise, it is hard to beat the
    accuracy of a person's calibrated eyeball, as long as their setup is
    well-controlled.</p>
