              Set to "fixed" to disable scaling of the model, which sets it to
              always be at 100% scale. Defaults to "auto" which allows the model to
              be resized.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <div>auto-rotate</div>

              <p>Sets the background image of the scene when viewed inline.
              Takes a URL to an <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equirectangular_projection">equirectangular
              projection image</a> that's used for the skybox, as well as
              applied as an environment map on the model. Supports png, jpg and

            <li>
              <div>camera-orbit</div>
              <span>
                <p>Set the starting and/or subsequent orbital position of the
                camera. You can control the azimuthal and polar angles, and the
                distance from the model. Accepts values of the form "$angle $angle
                $distance", like "10deg 75deg 1.5m". Also supports units in
                radians ("rad") for angles and centimeters ("cm") or millimeters
                ("mm") for camera distance. Camera distance can also be set as a
                percentage ('%'), where 100% gives the model tight framing within
                any window based on all possible theta and phi values. Any time
                this value changes from its initially configured value, the camera
                will interpolate from its current position to the new value.
                Any value set to 'auto' will revert to the default.</p>
                <p>For camera-orbit, camera-target and field-of-view, parts of the
                property value can be configured with CSS-like functions. The CSS
                calc() function is supported for these values, as well as a specialized
                form of the env() function. You can use env(window-scroll-y) anywhere
                in the expression to get a number from 0-1 that corresponds to the
                current top-level scroll position of the current frame. For example,
                a value like "calc(30deg - env(window-scroll-y) * 60deg) 75deg 1.5m"
                cause the camera to orbit horizontally around the model as the user
                scrolls down the page.</p>
                <p>Defaults to "0deg 75deg 105%"</p>
              </span>
            </li>
            <li>
              <div>camera-target</div>
              <p>Set the starting and/or subsequent point the camera orbits
              around. Accepts values of the form "$X $Y $Z", like "0m 1.5m
              -0.5m". Also supports units in centimeters ("cm") or millimeters
              ("mm"). A special value "auto" can be used, which sets the target
              to the center of the model's bounding box in that dimension. Any
              time this value changes from its initially configured value, the
              camera will interpolate from its current position to the new
              value. Defaults to "auto auto auto".</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <div>environment-image</div>
              <p>Controls the environmental reflection of the model. Normally if
              skybox-image is set, that image will also be used for the
              environment-image. Use environment-image to only set the reflection
              without affecting the background.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <div>exposure</div>
              <p>Controls the exposure of both the model and skybox, for use
              primarily with HDR environments. Defaults to 1.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <div>field-of-view</div>
              <p>Used to configure the vertical field of view of the camera.
              Accepts values units in both degrees and radians (e.g., "30deg" or
              "0.5rad"). Accepts any value between 10 and 45 degrees. Any time
              this value changes from its initially configured value, the camera
              will interpolate from its current value to the new value. Defaults
              to "auto", which sets either the vertical or horizontal field of
              view to 45 degrees depending on the dimensions of the model and the
              aspect ratio of the canvas.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <div>interaction-policy</div>
              <p>Allows you to change whether the viewer requires focus before
              interacting with it. If set to "allow-when-focused", the user must
              focus on the viewer (click / tap) before being able to control it.
              If set to "always-allow", the user can control it even if the
              viewer is not the focused element on the page. Defaults to
              "always-allow".</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <div>interaction-prompt</div>
              <p>Allows you to change the conditions under which the visual and
              audible interaction prompt will display. Allowed values are
              "auto", "when-focused" and "none". If set to "auto", the
              interaction prompt will be displayed as soon as the
              interaction-prompt-threshold (see below) time has elapsed (after
              the model is revealed). If set to "when-focused", the interaction
              prompt will only be activated if the element has first received
              focus. The interaction prompt will only display if camera-controls
              are enabled. Defaults to "auto".</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <div>interaction-prompt-style</div>
              <p>Configures the presentation style of the interaction-prompt when
              it is raised. The two allowed values are "wiggle" and "basic". When
              set to "wiggle", the prompt will animate from horizontally and the
              model will appear to be rotated as though the prompt is interacting
              with it. When set to "basic", the prompt is not animated, and instead
              simply appears until it is dismissed by user interaction.
              Defaults to "wiggle".</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <div>interaction-prompt-threshold</div>
              <p>When camera-controls are enabled, &lt;model-viewer&gt; will
              prompt the user visually (and audibly, for screen readers) to
              interact if they focus it but don't interact with it for some time.
              This attribute allows you to set how long &lt;model-viewer&gt;
              should wait (in milliseconds) before prompting to interact. Defaults
              to 3000.</p>

              Softness should not be changed every frame as it incurs a 
              performance cost. Softer shadows render faster. Defaults to 1.</p>

              always 0. This property can be set in order to seek along the

              always start paused, and remain so unless the autoplay attribute

              be cached. Note that any number of models may be cached at a given time.
              This number just sets the maximum number of models that can be cached even
              if they are not being used by a &lt;model-viewer&gt; element in the document.
              Note also that the cache size is measured in number of glTF models, not bytes!
              This is important to keep in mind, since any two models may have wildly

              <p>Activates AR. Note that for any mode that is not WebXR-based,
              this method most likely has to be called synchronous from a user
              interaction handler. Otherwise, attempts to activate modes that

            </li>
            <li>
              <div>dismissPoster()</div>
              <p>Dismisses the poster, causing the model to load and render if
              necessary. This is currently effectively the same as interacting
              with the poster via user input.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <div>getCameraOrbit()</div>
              <p>Returns the realtime orbital position of the camera. Azimuthal
              (theta) and polar (phi) angles are representred as radians, and the
              distance (radius) is represented in meters. This value may differ
              from the value configured with the camera-orbit attribute on account
              of user interaction or camera interpolation.</p>
            </li>
            <li>

            <li>
              <div>getCameraTarget()</div>
              <p>Returns the realtime target position of the camera in meters.
              This value may differ from the value configured with the
              camera-target attribute on account of user interaction or camera
              interpolation.</p>

            <li>
              <div>ModelViewer.mapURLs(callback)</div>
              <p>If provided, the callback will be passed each resource URL
              before a request is sent. The callback may return the original
              URL, or a new URL to override loading behavior. This behavior can
              be used to load assets from .ZIP files, drag-and-drop APIs, and
              Data URIs. This is a static method.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <div>play()</div>
              <p>Causes animations to be played. Use the autoplay attribute if
              you want animations to be played automatically. If there are no
              animations, nothing will happen, so make sure that the model is
              loaded before invoking this method.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <div>pause()</div>
              <p>Causes animations to be paused. If you want to reset the
              current animation to the beginning, you should also set the
              currentTime property to 0.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <div>resetTurntableRotation()</div>
              <p>Resets the turntable that rotates the model when auto-rotate
              is enabled. The new value of the turntable rotation will be 0 after
              this method is invoked, but the model may not update until the next
              render frame.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <div>toDataURL(type, encoderOptions)</div>
              <p>Returns a screenshot of the current model render in the format
              specified by <i>type</i> (defaults to image/png). The screenshot is
              encoded as a data URL string. In formats that support a sliding scale
              of quality (such as image/jpeg and image/webp) you can also specify a
              value for <i>encoderOptions</i> between 0 and 1 (<i>encoderOptions</i>
              defaults to 0.92 otherwise).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <div>toBlob(options: {mimeType, qualityArgument, idealAspect})</div>
              <p>Returns a promise that resolves into a Blob object in the
              format specified by the <i>mimeType</i> (defaults to image/png). A
              Blob object represents a file-like object of immutable, raw data.
              You can also specify a value between 0 and 1 for
              <i>qualityArgument</i> (Currently only available on Chrome desktop
              and Firefox) which defaults to 0.92 and 0.8 for image/png and
              image/webp respectively. By setting idealAspect to true, the blob
              will be captured at the ideal poster aspect ratio instead of the
              canvas aspect ratio. This allows for easy poster creation, where a
              single poster will match the render seamlessly at any canvas
              aspect ratio.</p>

            <li>
              <div>camera-change</div>
              <p>Fired when the camera position and/or field of view have
              changed. If the change occurred due to user interaction, the
              "event.detail.source" property will be set to
              "user-interaction".</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <div>environment-change</div>
              <p>Fired when the environment has changed. If the environment is
              derived from skybox-image or environment-image, the image will
              have loaded by the time this event fires.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <div>error</div>
              <p>This event can be triggered for two reasons: a model has failed
              to load or parse, or the WebGL context was lost. If the model failed
              to load, event.detail.type will be 'loadfailure'. If the WebGL context
              was lost, event.detail.type will be 'webglcontextlost'. In both cases,
              recovery countermeasures are left as an exercise for the user. The
              element will not make automatic attempts to re-load a model that has failed
              to load. Nor will the element attempt to restore the GL context after
              it has been lost. Error events also hold a reference to the originating
              error event (when there is one) as event.detail.sourceEvent.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <div>load</div>
              <p>Fired when a model is loaded. Can fire multiple times per <span
              class="attribute">&lt;model-viewer&gt;</span> if the src attribute
              is changed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <div>model-visibility</div>
              <p>This event is fired when the visibility of the model changes. When the
              model is loaded, able to be rendered and fully visible (e.g., the poster is no longer
              visible), this event will fire and <span class="attribute">event.detail.visible</span>
              will be "true". Note that this event will fire regardless of whether the model is 
              present in the viewport. This means that the model may not be rendered yet (as we
              do not render models that are outside of the viewport) even though the event says
              that the model is visible.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <div>poster-visibility</div>
              <p>This event is fired when the visiblity of the poster image
              changes. The current visibility state can be read from the
              <span class="attribute">event.detail.visible</span> property</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <div>play</div>
              <p>Dispatched when animations begin to play.</p>

            <li>
              <div>pause</div>
              <p>Dispatched when animations are paused. A model always begins in
              the paused state, so it is worth mentioning that this event will not
              be dispatched until the the pause() method is invoked after
              animations have begun playing.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
