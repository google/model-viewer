## Description

This model uses the KHR_materials_variants extension. It is a shoe with 3 color variants in it: "Beach", "Midnight", and "Street".

If each variant was a separate model, they would be 5.4 MB each. Combined they make up a single model that is 7.8MB since they share geometry and all textures except the base color texture.
